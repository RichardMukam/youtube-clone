<!-- html: three types of elements
block element - takes up an entire line (paragraph)
forced to be on their own line (margins take up the entire

inline-block element - takes up as much space as 
it needs to
doesn't take up the entire line (image, input)

inline element - text elements that appear within lines of
text (strong, u)

the block and inline-block elements determine how the elements
are displayed (beside one another or above/below)

then, use its options (inline-block, block, inline)-->

<!--in css, adding a comma between two classes makes the
forward styles apply to both classes-->

<!--display: appear on same line or not.-->
