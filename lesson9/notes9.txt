A div (division) is simply a box
It is a block element
Can contain other elements within (paragraphs, images, other divs)
Meant to be containers for specific elements
In order to create complex websites, we need divs. 
Perfect solution
Can change the width of a div
Looking at a YouTube page, we'd want separate sections for video previews,
but not lines on the entire page. 
Putting elements within a contianer allows for its size to be restricted
To center contents within a div, wrap all the lines of code 
within the div, then use text-align on the div. Make sure that 
uses of "display: block" are removed or else you won't be able
to center the contents.
